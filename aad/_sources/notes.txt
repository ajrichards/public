.. AAD study

Notes and things to keep in mind
================================


In terms of the meta-analysis
-------------------------------

   * case/control vs other comparisons
   * use provided normalized data as a first pass
   * study level covariates: age, gender, smoking, race 
   * meta-analysis of p-values or exp. ratios should include disease state and laboratory as a co-variate

Potential issues
--------------------    
    
   * are there sample ids that go across studies
   * need to ensure that a sample is not used twice
    
GEO file types
--------------------

   * GEO Platform (GPL) - These files describe a particular type of microarray. They are annotation files.
   * GEO Sample (GSM) - Files that contain all the data from asingle chip. For each gene there will be multiple scores including the main one, held in the VALUE column.
   * GEO Series (GSE) - Lists of GSM files that together form a single experiment.
   * GEO Dataset (GDS) - Curated files with a combination of a GSE file and its GSM files. They contain normalised exp. levels for each gene from each sample (i.e. just the VALUE field from the GSM file).
