Transcriptome supplemental materials for *Pieris brassicae*
=============================================================

This is the supplement for the paper entitled A functional investigation of Cabbage Butterfly (*Pieris brassicae*) dispersal transcriptome.  The large white butterfly or cabbage butterfly [Feltwell82]_ is a species that well-suited for the study of dispersal genetics [Baguette13]_.  The analysis of high-throughput sequencing data can involve piplines of many types.  In the spirit of reproducability and because there is a lot of information contained within the *P. brassicae* transcriptome we present here the assembly and supporting materials for the transcriptome manuscript.
